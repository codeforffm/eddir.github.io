# Schools, nurseries and playgrounds in Frankfurt/M - Germany

## Description

This project was created during the Open Data Day 2015 at a Hackathon in Frankfurt.

The project provides an overview of all schools, KITAs and playgrounds in Frankfurt, with addition information to each school, nursery or playgrounds.

We differentiate between the different school types (Grundschule, Hauptschule, Realschule, Gymnasium, etc.) and the different types of KITAs (under age of 3, under age of 6, etc.)
