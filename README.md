# Schools and nurseries in Frankfurt/M - Germany

## Description

This project was created during the Open Data Day 2015 at a Hackathon in Frankfurt.

The project provides an overview of all schools and KITAs in Frankfurt, with addition information to each school or nursery.

We differentiate between the different school types (Grundschule, Hauptschule, Realschule, Gymnasium, etc.) and the different types of KITAs (under age of 3, under age of 6, etc.)

More information on this project can be found here: [https://pad.okfn.org/p/codeforffm](https://pad.okfn.org/p/codeforffm) under the section **"KITAs/Kindergarden/School Directory"**.
